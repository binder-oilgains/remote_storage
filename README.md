# Remote Storage with Binder

[![Binder](http://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](http://beta.mybinder.org/v2/gh/binder-oilgains/remote_storage/main)

A Binder-compatible repo that shows accessing data from remote sources. It uses the Python package `boto`. Boto is a Python package that provides interfaces to Amazon Web Services. 


Access this Binder at the following URL:

## Notes
The notebooks use `boto` and `requests` to load both images and tables from S3.
The image loading makes use of `PIL` and the table loading
makes use of `pandas`.
